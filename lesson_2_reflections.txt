What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a new repository you are taking what is just a directory of files on your computer and recognizing it as a repository in git for you to sotre parts of your project. This is necessary so that you can begin to make commits in git and use the other git operators to modify, edit and complete your project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area serves as a middle man between the working directory and your repository. I think it has value in that it allows you to review the files that you are going to add to the repo before you make the commit. Lets you do a double-check to ensure that the changes are logical.
